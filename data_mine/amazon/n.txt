unimaginably bad bought despite bad reviews thought impossible anne movie bad managed pull burn green gables create chemistry anne another man things anne gil cold come peopleall want good chick flick nice ending
disappointing absolutely loved first two anne movies heard finally making another movie excited see extremely disappointed movie thoroughly strayed lm montgomerys enchanting story line story line nothing like true story anne although may think good movie way worthy carry name anne green gables plot movie held interest extremely disappointing
disappointing third installment series dramatizations lucy maud montgomerys beloved anne green gables novels megan follows jonathon crombie return usual roles unfortunately third production meet high standards set first faithful installment total seven anne novels montgomery provided fully enough amusing sentimental unabashedly romantic material three movies pity second production anne green gables sequel departed somewhat novels crime third production leaves montgomery behind entirely transporting characters forward time pitchforking trite war plot resolving incoherent plot elements tepid candycoated ending
dissapointed say least remember watching anne green gables anne avonlea movies child start finish immediately rewinding start movie intirely different story far cry book version found incredibly insulting antiamerican sediment found throughout movie something took heart belive kevin sullivan wonderful job alienating much audience thoughtless comments made film much respect half people supported buying movies never buy another one films unfortunatly movie never share children
